### Hi! :whale:

I'm an undergrad student and ~~part~~ full time learner juggling a million ideas at all times :sparkles:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on front end web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript! I'm on the road to becoming a full stack developer and learning both front end and backend frameworks. 

## âš¡ How I work:

I'm a quick learner, always curious and looking to expand my skillset! As a side project, I also work on design and illustrations using traditional mediums as well as digital.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:
- Email: gayathri.u.2014@gmail.com

## ðŸ˜„ When I'm not on here, you can find me:
- Geeking out about random things on the internet :globe_with_meridians:
- Discovering new music or reading webcomics :book:
- Making friends with ever dog I see :paw_prints:
